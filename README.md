# Always Open Privately
Firefox add-on to always open specific websites in private windows.

This Firefox add-on provides to configure a whitelist domain names. If a domain name matches a domain on the whitelist, this add-on will try to prevent Firefox from loading the website a non-private window, open a new private window and load the website there.

Because of how webextension add-ons work, it is not always possible to prevent Firefox from loading a website. However, this add-on will always open a new private window and load the website there.

So far, the add-on only works with HTTP and HTTPS, but not with FTP.

## Usage

Always Open Privately needs the permission to run in private windows. This setting may be set manually in the add-on manager in Firefox.

In the settings panel, add one domain per line.
